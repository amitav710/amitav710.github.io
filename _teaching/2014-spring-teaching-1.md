I'll be one of the instructors for the **Introduction to Deep Learning** course, which provides introductory knowledge about **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative Models**. The course is organized by Quark Controls, at BITS Pilani - Goa, during summer 2022. It is an 8 week course.
