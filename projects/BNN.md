[[code & report]](https://github.com/amitav710/SAiDL-Spring-Assignment-2022/tree/main/BNNusingMCMC) Implemented a **Bayesian Neural Network** to classify a simple noisy XOR dataset. The model can be extended to work with more complex datasets. Defined **posterior and likelihood functions** and used **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** sampling, using the **Metropolisâ€‘Hastings** algorithm.
