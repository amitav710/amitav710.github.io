[[code & report]](https://github.com/amitav710/Calorie-Estimation-YOLOv5) 
An implementation of a Food Calorie estimator using YOLOv5 on the ECUSTFD food dataset. This model takes into account bounding box width and height taken from both top and side views as well as
the food item class using YOLOv5 for object detection. Using these as input parameters, we train a simple ANN to give the calories contained as a regression output.
